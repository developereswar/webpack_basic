Webpack Basic Practice
This repository serves as a practical exercise for understanding the fundamental concepts of Webpack, including how to configure it for bundling JavaScript applications and managing assets.

What Was Practiced
In this project, I focused on the core functionalities of Webpack to achieve efficient asset management and code bundling. Key areas of practice include:

Entry Points: Defining where Webpack should start building its dependency graph.

Output Configuration: Specifying where the bundled files should be emitted and how they should be named.

Loaders: Using loaders (e.g., babel-loader for transpiling JavaScript, css-loader and style-loader for CSS) to process different types of files.

Plugins: Implementing plugins (e.g., HtmlWebpackPlugin for generating HTML files, CleanWebpackPlugin for cleaning build directories) to perform a wide range of tasks like asset optimization, injection, and environment setup.

Development vs. Production Modes: Differentiating configurations for development (faster builds, source maps) and production (minification, optimization).

Asset Management: Handling various assets like images and fonts.

Getting Started
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.

Node.js

npm (usually comes with Node.js) or Yarn

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone git@github.com:developereswar/webpack_basic.git
cd your-repo-name


Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install

How to Build and Use Bundles
Webpack's primary role is to take your source code and its dependencies, process them, and output optimized "bundles" that can be deployed to a web server.

Building the Project
To compile the project and generate the optimized bundles, use the following command:

npm run build

This project demonstrates a basic setup, and Webpack's capabilities extend far beyond this, allowing for complex optimizations, code splitting, and advanced asset pipelines.
